Depends on ruby-assertions

In all database driven application I need the following:

  1) declare model
  3) create scheme, update scheme, migrations
  2) derive forms from model
    This also could be "only derive html input fields :A,:B,:C from table foo"

With active record like code this just doesn't work, because you have to edit
so many places - no way to get your job done fast

So this library provides a way to declare a model, it allows you to attach
constraints and it derives scheme upgrades for you.
